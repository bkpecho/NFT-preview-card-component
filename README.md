## Overview

The project in this repository is a challenge from Frontend Mentor and is being completed as part of the #100daysofcode challenge. This repository contains a responsive website that was created as part of the challenge, built with HTML and CSS. The website features hover effects and the goal of the project is to showcase the developer's skills in creating responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing web designs. The website is optimized for different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### What I learned

Improved HTML and CSS skills: Through the creation of this project, I was able to practice and improve my HTML and CSS skills, including using HTML to structure the content and CSS to style it.

Deeper understanding of hover effects: This project also allowed me to delve deeper into hover effects, including how to create and apply them in HTML and CSS. I learned how to use the :hover pseudo-class in CSS to change the style of an element when a user hovers over it, adding an extra layer of interactivity to the website.

By working on this project, I was able to strengthen my existing skills and gain new knowledge, which will be valuable as I continue to develop my abilities as a frontend developer.
